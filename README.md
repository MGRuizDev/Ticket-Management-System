# Ticket-Management-System
This small javaScript implementation was build through a youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYq9J-Eur9U
It is a simple form that will record issues events through three data requests from the user; a description of the issue, the level of importance, and the technician in charge.
It is mainly JavaScript and HTML, althouhg I integrete a bit of css to stylish it a bit.
